1. About Us

About AadiKarta

AadiKarta is a digital platform designed to bridge the gap between experienced astrologers and individuals seeking guidance, clarity, and insights into their lives. We provide a trusted space where seekers can connect with professional astrologers for consultations related to astrology, numerology, vastu, tarot, and other traditional and modern metaphysical sciences.

Our mission is to make authentic astrological guidance accessible, transparent, and convenient through technology. We believe astrology is a tool for self-reflection and informed decision-making, not a substitute for personal judgment or professional advice.

At AadiKarta, we focus on:

Verified and experienced astrologers

Secure and seamless online consultations

Respect for user privacy and confidentiality

Ethical and responsible spiritual guidance

We do not promote superstition or guarantee outcomes. Our platform encourages seekers to use astrological insights as supportive guidance while making their own informed choices.
